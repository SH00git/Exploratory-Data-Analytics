### Exploratory Analysis of Road Accident Data:
- Code:https://github.com/SH00git/Exploratory-Data-Analytics/blob/main/P3.0Accident%20Data%20_.ipynb
- Dashboard: https://github.com/SH00git/Exploratory-Data-Analytics/blob/main/P3.2Road-Acc-Data-BI-Dash.pbix
  
The road accident database contains the following list of features
 Accident_Index, Accident Date, Day_of_Week, Junction_Control, Junction_Detail, Accident_Severity,  Latitude,  Light_Conditions, Local_Authority_(District) , Carriageway_Hazards, Longitude,  Number_of_Casualties, Number_of_Vehicles, Police_Force, Road_Surface_Conditions, Road_Type, Speed_limit, Time, Urban_or_Rural_Area, Weather_Conditions, Vehicle_Type                

- Data Cleaning ( filling missing values, nan, removing outliers, converting data types, cleaning tetx columns, handing data imbalances)
-Exploratory analysis on the dataset is performed to gain insights ( barplot, histplot, countplot)
- The cleaned data is then exported to csv file and visualised in forms of charts and dashbords in PowerBI software

  ### Migratory Birds Tracking
  - Dataset:https://github.com/SH00git/Exploratory-Data-Analytics/blob/main/Bird%20Tracking.ipynb
  - Code:

    - Data Visualisation : Scatter Plots, Line plots -visualising the trajectory, mean speed of the different bird species, geoplotting the migratory route in cartopy library
